Discrimination may be direct or indirect.

## 4. Types of Discrimination

4.1.  **Direct Discrimination**
This occurs when a person or a policy intentionally treats a person less favourably than another on the grounds of race, sex, pregnancy and maternity, marital or civil partnership status, gender reassignment, disability, religion or beliefs, age or sexual orientation.

4.2.  **Indirect & Institutional Discrimination**
This is the application of a policy, criterion or practice which the employer applies to all employees but which is such that:

-   It is it detrimental to a considerably larger proportion of people from the group that the person the employer is applying it to represents;
    
-   The employer cannot justify the need for the application of the policy on a neutral basis; and
    
-   The person to whom the employer is applying it suffers detriment from the application of the policy.
    
| **Example** |
|-------------|
| **A requirement that all employees must be 6ft tall if that requirement is not justified by the position would indirectly discriminate against employees with an oriental ethnic origin, as they are less likely to be able to fulfil this requirement.** |


4.3.  **Harassment**
This occurs when a person is subjected to unwanted conduct that has the purpose or effect of violating their dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.

4.4. **Victimisation**
This occurs when a person is treated less favourably because they have bought or intend to bring proceedings or they have given or intend to give evidence.


## 5. Unlawful Reasons for Discrimination
5.1.  **Sex**
It is not permissible to treat a person less favourably on the grounds of sex, marital status, civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity, gender reassignment or transgender status. This applies to men, women and those undergoing or intending to undergo gender reassignment. Sexual harassment of men and women can be found to constitute sex discrimination.

| **Example** |
|-------------|
| **Asking a woman during an interview if she is planning to have any (more) children constitutes discrimination on the ground of gender.** |


5.2.  **Age**
It is not permissible to treat a person less favourably because of their age. This applies to people of all ages. This does not currently apply to the calculation of redundancy payments.

5.3.  **Disability**
It is not permissible to treat a disabled person less favourably than a non-disabled person. Reasonable adjustments must be made to give the disabled person as much access to any services and ability to be employed, trained, or promoted as a non-disabled person.

Axelisys limited seek to ensure websites, desktop, mobile and web applications designed for clients conforms to accessibility standards including W3C WAI WCAG 2.0 Level AA when appropriate or in the client’s best interests. All websites and web applications designed for accessibility will be analysed in-house, or by a third party to ensure compliance with the standard.

All new projects should be built and tested for compliance with the WCAG 2.0 AA standards and are required to be:

-   Perceivable  
-   Operable
-   Understandable
-   Robust
    
Any websites currently live will be evaluated and incrementally improve in alignment with WCAG 2.0 AA and any emerging accessibility needs.

5.4.  **Technology**
The use of assistive and new technologies, such as screen readers and voice recognition systems should also be a consideration during the evaluation of client needs. It should be considered a first-class concern for web facing developments where accessibility is a concern. Development of new technologies in house, through a research and development programme, may be used for internal and external projects and programme of work, as well as leading the way in accessible technologies. All technological and procedural means of enabling occupational equality should be considered in evaluating improvements to working practises, making adjustments to both internal and external user systems, in acknowledgement of the possibility accessible technologies have greater benefits far beyond users with usability impairments.

5.5 **Race**
It is not permissible to treat a person less favourably because of their race, the colour of their skin, their nationality or their ethnic origin. We operate a “zero tolerance” policy towards such behaviour.

5.6.  **Sexual Orientation**
It is not permissible to treat a person less favourably because of their sexual orientation. For example, an employer cannot refuse to employ a person because s/he is homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual. We operate a “zero tolerance” policy towards such behaviour.

5.7.  **Religion or Religious Belief**
It is not permissible to treat a person less favourably because of their religious beliefs or their religion or their lack of any religion or belief. Any allegations of religious or racial hatred will be investigated.

5.8.  **Gender Identity**
It is not permissible to treat a person less favourably because of their gender identity. Any allegations of discrimination or hatred directed towards any persons’ identity, will not be tolerated and will be fully investigated. We operate a “zero tolerance” policy towards such behaviour.

5.9.  **Salvation**
Nothing in the above list shall entitle any individual or group with one or more protected characteristics to discriminate against another individual or group with other protected characteristics.

## 6. Positive Action in Recruitment
Under the Equality Act 2010, positive action in recruitment and promotion applies as of 6 April 2011. ‘Positive action’ means the steps that the Company can take to encourage people from groups with different needs or with a past record of disadvantage or low participation, to apply for positions within the Company.

If the Company chooses to utilise positive action in recruitment, this will not be used to treat people with a protected characteristic more favorably, it will be used only in a total tie-break situations, when there are two candidates of equal merit applying for the same position.

## 7.  Reasonable Adjustments
The Company has a duty to make reasonable adjustments to facilitate the employment of a disabled person. These may include:

7.1.  Making adjustments to premises;
