# Grievance Policy and Procedure 
## 1. Introduction
The organisation’s Disciplinary procedures are designed to maintain the organisation’s performance. As an economic operator in a regulated sector, especially the environment, the protection of social and environmental responsibility is paramount. 

Sometimes, employees may have reason to raise a complaint against the organisation. This is called “raising a grievance” which should follow this procedure. 
## 2. Dealing with grievances informally
If you have a grievance or complaint about your work or someone you work with you should start by speaking with your manager wherever possible. You may be able to agree a solution informally between you.
## 3. Formal grievance
If the matter is serious or you wish to raise it formally you should put the grievance in writing to your manager. You should keep to the facts and avoid language that is insulting or abusive.

If your grievance is against your manager and you feel unable to approach them, you should raise it with your line manager’s line manager or the owner.
## 4. Grievance hearing
Your manager will call you to a meeting, usually within 5 working days, to discuss your grievance. You have the right to be accompanied by a colleague or trade union representative. 

After the meeting your manager will give you a decision in writing, usually within 3 working days.

If the manager needs more information before making a decision, they will inform you of this and the timescale.
## 5. Appeal
If you are unhappy with the decision on your grievance you can raise an appeal. You should tell your manager if you with the raise an appeal.

You will be invited to an appeal meeting, normally within 10 working days, with a more senior manager (or the owner). You have the right to be accompanied by a colleague or trade union representative from a recognised trade union body.

After the meeting the manager (or owner) will give you a decision, usually within 5 working days. The manager’s (or owner’s) decision is final.
